# Engineering
VISION: Engineers with solid fundamentals and problem-solving skills are always valuable in the market and open source community.

Good Engineers:
- Understand a complex system
- Modify the system to add a feature
- ship the new system (test well and stuff)
- Technical depth and passion
- Be a master of some domain
- Get things done in a clean way
- Mindset: be careful, and cognizant and mindful of the different choices you are making
- Time: 90% data structure + 10% code
- Stress lead to burnouts，burnout results in less output than reducing workload, taking a break, and optimizing for the long term.
